            We offer high quality 3D printing services using our industry standard 3D printers. We offer a range of materials, specialising in PLA, in which we provide a wide range of colours, including white, silver and black.

            We provide our customers with the abiity to adjust the desired quality of the print. Adjusting the quality of the print will change the total cost of the print job, allowing us at Imagination Printing to provide our customers with a extensive range of cost effective options.

              Should you not be able to find the desired model you wish to print online, or you simply need something modelled with standary industry CAD/CAM tools, we offer the experience of several years of intensive use of programs such as AutoDesk Inventor, Fusion 360 and CATIA v5. These programs are used by companies such as Boeing Aerospace Company and Robotis Technologies.
              <br><br>
              First we will discuss what you need from the model, and all the features and requirements you wish to see from the model, and then our team of experts will assemble the model online. <br>We then go through a phase of where clients offer feedback, tweaking the model as they seem fit, with the assistance of our friendly staff. Once the model is completed we send you the model in a variety of formats available for 3D printing, showcasing and editing.<br><br>
