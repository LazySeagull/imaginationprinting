          Ben is a first year university student undertaking a full time double degree in both Mechatronic Engineering (Honours) and Computer Science. They has been playing with 3D printers for the past 4-5 years, and has been designing CAD/CAM models for even longer. <br><br> 
          Ben has lead engineering clubs in high school, such as the international Rapidly Manufactured Rescue League team "Kings Legacy", who recently placed 3rd at Robocup, Sydney in 2019. Ben continues to provide their skills to the club, through the designing of new robots, to maintaining previous competitions robots.<br><br>
